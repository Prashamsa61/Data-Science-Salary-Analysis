\section{Experimental Results}
\subsection{Salary Comparision of Data Scientists and Data Engineers based on expertise levels in the United States}
\textbf{This visualization explores the relationship between expertise level and salary for Data Scientists and Data Engineers in the United States. As the expertise level is good the salry is seen to be improved as well in both of the cases.While comparing the Data Scientist Job is seemes to have high income in case of expert and intermediate expertise.}
